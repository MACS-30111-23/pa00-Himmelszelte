# 你好, Hello, Guten Tag, 안녕하세요,  My Name is Siyu Guan
Hi again, I am Siyu 关斯瑜 and I'm from China. 

I graduated from the University of Arizona with a major in Sociology and two minors in Criminology and German Studies. 

Right now, I am in the MAPSS program at the University of Chicago with a focus on Sociology.

## Few Q&A About Myself
How to pronounce my name?
* I have recorded how to read my name in Mandarin Chinese and "English" (I altered the version to make it easier for anyone who doesn't speak Chinese to pronounce and remember, and it works!).
* For non-Chinese speakers, I told them to pronounce my name as "See-you", and I always say: "just like 'see you later!'"

What is my current biggest worry?
* As someone who was born and raised in Southeast China and someone who finished their undergraduate study in the desert area, I have ***NEVER EVER*** lived or experienced a climate of snow before. And here I am currently living in Chicago.
* I had no idea what to expect, and when I read the fine print from my apartment, they told me I needed to keep the door open inside and let my faucets drip a little so the pipe wouldn't freeze in winter, that's when I started to panic a little.
* Not to mention I have stored dry foods in my pantry right now because again, I don't know what to expect. (And it's getting chilly!)

## Few Facts About Me
* My family and I have 4 cats
* I have 9 ear piercings
* I can speak 5 different languages (and the fifth one is the dialect from my hometown which has no writing form)
* My favorite PC game is [Final Fantasy XIV](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/), and this is my 7th year playing it
* Baekhyun, Halsey, and Taylor Swift are my Top 3 favorite musician
* I also enjoy building Legos, I own more than 40 sets of Legos (all built) from world-famous architectures to a tuxedo cat
* Photo below is my most recent "big project": Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris <br>

## Summary and Reflection 
Honestly, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing on this site at the beginning, and I have no experience with coding either. The closest experiences I have with these kinds of things are either programming a tiny car on the computer and making it draw shapes out on the screen or writing a series of commands in Final Fantasy XIV to make my character perform certain actions. In the beginning, there is definitely frustration involved. After panicking, I discovered the pattern. When I adapted the pattern and used the commands on my own creating the content above, it felt amazing. It's just like the feeling of building something I got when I build my Lego sets.

Through this homework, I learned a few codes that could turn the page into a simple website with organized content. I was surprised at first because the system operates differently from WORD and other Microsoft Office software, especially when I tried to make some words bold and in bigger sizes. By finishing this assignment, I was also introduced to a different kind of thought process, or to say, logic of processing and thinking? Either way, I am enjoying this newly learned skill and can't wait to explore more.
